## Website Overview

### Site Address
- **Frontend:** [https://bloxk-address.vercel.app/](https://bloxk-address.vercel.app/)
- **Backend:** [https://bloxk-address-be-production.up.railway.app/](https://bloxk-address-be-production.up.railway.app/)
- **API Documentation:** [https://bloxk-address-be-production.up.railway.app/api](https://bloxk-address-be-production.up.railway.app/api)

### Infrastructure
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Nest.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Railway (with CI/CD)

### Features
1. **Address Submission:** Users can submit blockchain addresses via a form.
2. **Data Storage:** Submitted addresses are stored in MongoDB via the backend.
3. **CSV Export:** Users can download a CSV file containing all submitted addresses.

## Backend Implementation

### Workflow
1. **Request Handling:** 
   - Incoming requests pass through a middleware layer to check for an API key.
   - If the API key (`x-api-key`) is missing, the response returns with a warning.
   
2. **Throttling:**
   - The server checks for throttling based on the same IP, currently set to a maximum of 10 requests per minute.

3. **Validation:**
   - The request reaches the DTO (Data Transfer Object) layer where it undergoes validation (e.g., required fields, min/max length, uniqueness).

4. **Controller Layer:**
   - Each request is routed to the appropriate controller endpoint.

5. **Service Layer:**
   - Data is retrieved from MongoDB via the schema model.
   - Schemas are generated using the Mongoose tool.

6. **Response Handling:**
   - Successful requests are modified by an interceptor to ensure the response format is as needed.

7. **Exception Handling:**
   - All exceptions are managed by an exception filter in the `AppModule` to standardize the response structure.

## Frontend Implementation

### Workflow
1. **Form Handling:**
   - Uses a simple form via the Formik library.
   - Simultaneously checks for validation as the user inputs data.
   - Validation schema is generated by Yup.
   - Validation-related error messages are displayed below the corresponding input fields.

2. **API Requests:**
   - Each request is handled by separate hooks for the module.
   - Utilizes a generic fetcher for handling all API requests.
   - Exceptions from API calls are shown as error toasts with messages from the backend.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Tool:** Railway ([https://railway.app/](https://railway.app/))
- **Process:**
  - Connects to the GitHub repository and automatically deploys whenever a specific branch has a new commit.
  - Environment variables can be easily injected.
  - MongoDB can also be deployed on Railway.
  - Provides a one-stop service for all deployments (backend, frontend, database).
  - Once set up, all deployments are automated whenever a commit is pushed to the selected branch.

## APIs

### Authentication
- All endpoints require an `x-api-key` header.
- API keys are currently hardcoded and stored in MongoDB. New keys can be added directly to MongoDB.

### Endpoints

1. **POST /address**
   - **Purpose:** Add a new address.
   - **Payload:** The address input from the user.
   - **Behavior:**
     - Stores the address, IP, and createdDate in MongoDB.
     - Responds with the address and createdDate if successful.
     - Responds with exception info if failed.

2. **GET /address**
   - **Purpose:** Retrieve all stored addresses.
   - **Parameters:** None.
   - **Behavior:**
     - Responds with an array of addresses, each containing an address and createdDate.

3. **GET /csv/generate**
   - **Purpose:** Download a CSV file containing all addresses.
   - **Behavior:**
     - Fetches all addresses (same as `GET /address`).
     - Adds them to a CSV file.
     - Returns the CSV file as the response.

> **Note:** Detailed API documentation can be found in the Swagger API documentation at [https://bloxk-address-be-production.up.railway.app/api](https://bloxk-address-be-production.up.railway.app/api).
